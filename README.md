# spark-json-schema

This goal of the spark-json-schema library is to support input data integrity when loading json data into Apache Spark.
For this purpose the library:
    
- Reads in an existing json-schema file
- Parses the json-schema and builds a Spark DataFrame schema

This generated schema can be used when loading json data into Spark.
This verifies that the input data conforms to the given schema and enables to filter out corrupt input data.
 

# Quickstart

Include the library under the following coordinates:

    libraryDependencies += "org.zalando" %% "spark-json-schema" % "0.2"

Parse a given json-schema file by providing the path to the input file:
    
    val schema = SchemaConverter.convert("schemaFile.json")
    
Use the created schema when loading json-files into Spark:
    
    val dataFrame = sqlContext.read.schema(schema).json(source)
 
Jsons that are not according to the schema have only `null` in the dataFrame fields and can be filtered out:
    
    val filteredData = dataFrame.rdd.filter( x => Range(0, x.length).contains(!x.isNullAt(_)))
    
After these steps you can be sure that all files that were loaded for further processing comply to your schema.
